I recently started using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) as my [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) in order to get some experience with designing my website (hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/SebastianPrehn/SebastianPrehn.github.io).

I chose Zola because it is fast, is written in Rust, and because the majority of the text on the site can be formatted using Markdown.
Although I am an Org mode user and know that [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/) exists, I still prefer to use Markdown since that is what the majority of the alternatives I was looking at was using as well.

Org can also export to Markdown, so it ended up being a non-issue if I decided I could not live without Org.

I decided to start a blog because that's how I consume most content online.
Through RSS/atom in my [Elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) reader.

The topics will wander: algorithms that fascinate me, tutorials on tools I love, or half-baked ideas I'm still working through.

Welcome to my blog.

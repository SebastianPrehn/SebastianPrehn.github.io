I'm Sebastian, a Danish [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) and Computer Science Master's student at the University of Copenhagen. I'm passionate about building secure, privacy-respecting systems and exploring the fundamental questions of how computers work, and how we can improve them.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen in 2024.
During my bachelor's studies in 2021, I revived an old board game club called [DICON](https://dicon.dk/), which I have served as chair of ever since. I care deeply about the student environment, which led me to join the Study Board for three years, with my last year serving as co-chair before stepping down to focus on my studies. I completed my Bachelor's project as well as one other project under guidance of [Valkyrie Savage](https://valkyriesavage.com/). She sparked my interest in performing research, and although I shifted my focus to programming languages as well as privacy and security rather than Human-Centred Computing, she remains an inspiration to this day.

Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's degree, where my core study area lies in programming languages and theory of computing. I focus on acquiring the theoretical foundations to better reason about systems, including semantics and implementation of advanced programming techniques.

My primary research focus is computer security and privacy. I am particularly interested in privacy-preserving technologies such as secure communication protocols and cryptography, as well as securing computer systems more broadly. I believe deeply that every human being deserves privacy. The right to choose selectively what they share about themselves. I want to help build systems that preserve this fundamental right.


I identify with the word [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker) despite its modern connotations. To me, this means approaching technology with curiosity, creativity, and a desire to understand our machines more deeply. It's a celebration of the excitement and satisfaction of making things work exactly how you want them to.

GNU Emacs is my editor of choice, and it embodies much of what I love about software: It is customizable, deeply extensible, and rewards the time one invests in understanding it.


While I spend much of my time with computers, I also try to balance it with physical activity and time in nature.

I enjoy hiking because it connects me with the nature around me and clears my mind. I mostly do day-hikes, but plan to do longer hikes with a friend group from university.

I also enjoy bouldering, as I really consider it to be a set of problems which you have to solve utilizing your body. It's good exercise, it's fun to do together with friends, and while it is expensive, it's a hobby you can do at any time of the year.

Similarly, I recently started practicing Olympic sabre fencing, which drew me in with the speed, strategy, and execution required to perform well.


This website serves as a space for me to share my thoughts, document my learning journey in a myriad of different topics, and connect with others interested in similar topics. I'm always interested in discussing security and privacy, or simply exchanging ideas about technology.
